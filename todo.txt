# TODO: Swing Trading Improvement Plan (aiming for very high accuracy)

- [ ] Always read README.md and digest.txt before changes

Core goal: maximize swing-trading recommendation quality (target high precision). We will prioritize precision over volume, use robust confirmations, and validate with out-of-sample testing.

1) Data quality and reliability
- [x] Replace any residual synthetic/offline data paths with live sources only (verify all fetch flows)
- [x] Add multi-provider reconciliation for OHLCV (NSE official + Yahoo direct + backup). If providers disagree, flag symbol for skip.
- [x] Enforce trading-days continuity check; drop symbols with >2% missing bars in last 2y
- [x] Normalize splits/dividends and corporate actions; re-check adjusted series
- [x] Cache raw vendor payloads + normalized OHLCV to detect upstream drift

2) Swing-trading signal design (precision-first)
- [x] Add trend filter: ADX(14) > 20 and price above 200SMA for long-only signals
- [x] Multi-timeframe confirmation: Daily signal must not contradict Weekly trend (W 20/50 SMA up)
- [x] Volatility gate: ATR(14) within 20th–80th pct (avoid chop and extreme spikes)
- [x] Volume confirmation: OBV uptrend OR Volume Z-score > 1 on breakout day
- [x] Entry patterns to implement/strengthen:
  - [x] Pullback to rising 20EMA with bullish reversal candle + RSI(14) 40–60 rising
  - [x] Bollinger band squeeze breakout with retest and hold
  - [x] MACD(12,26,9) signal cross above zero-line only (filter many false crosses)
  - [x] Higher-low swing structure (pivot-based) before entry
- [x] Exit rules:
  - [x] Initial SL = recent swing low (or 1.5×ATR below entry)
  - [x] TP1 = 1×ATR, move SL to BE; TP2 = 2–2.5×ATR; optional trail = 3×ATR chandelier
  - [x] Time-stop: exit if no progress after 12–15 bars

3) Scoring and recommendation thresholds
- [x] Rebalance weights to favor technical and volume confirmations for swing context
- [x] Require ALL gates to pass: trend filter + volatility gate + volume confirmation
- [x] Raise BUY thresholds, lower SELL generation to avoid noise (see Config changes)
- [x] Produce fewer, higher-confidence picks; add reason strings explaining each gate pass

3) Backtesting, validation and robustness
- [x] Implement strict walk-forward: 2018–2021 train, 2022 validate, 2023–2024 test (rolling)
- [x] Use purged K-fold CV to avoid leakage on overlapping bars
- [x] Evaluate precision/PPV of BUY signals at 10/20 trading-day horizons, not just CAGR
- [x] Report hit-rate, avg R multiple, max adverse excursion (MAE), and time-in-trade
- [x] Perform ablation tests per gate (trend, volatility, volume) to quantify lift
- [x] Monte Carlo resample trade sequence to estimate downside risk

5) Risk and position sizing
- [x] Enforce risk-per-trade cap (e.g., 0.5–1.0% of equity)
- [x] Use ATR-based position sizing for consistent risk across symbols
- [x] Portfolio-level guards: max 5 concurrent positions, sector concentration c= 40%
- [x] Hard daily loss cap; pause signals after breach

6) Data/infra performance and reliability
- [x] Tune rate-limits; add jitter and vendor-specific backoffs
- [x] Expand cache keys by symbol+provider+date-range to avoid collisions
- [x] Add integrity checksums for cached frames
- [x] Observability: structured logs for each gate decision; daily summary (structured logs added; daily summary pending)

7) Config changes to propose (backend/config.py)
- [x] STRATEGY_CONFIG: enable swing-relevant indicators once stable
  - [x] Enable: 'ADX_Trend_Strength', 'On_Balance_Volume', 'ATR_Volatility', 'SMA_Crossover_20_50', 'Stochastic_Overbought_Oversold' (with strict filters), 'Multi_Timeframe_RSI'
  - [x] Keep heavy/unstable items disabled until validated
- [x] HISTORICAL_DATA_PERIOD: change '2y' -> '5y' to improve regime coverage
- [x] ANALYSIS_WEIGHTS (proposed): {'technical': 0.55, 'fundamental': 0.20, 'sentiment': 0.10, 'sector': 0.05, 'predictive': 0.05, 'rl_agent': 0.05}
- [x] RECOMMENDATION_THRESHOLDS (proposed stricter):
  - [x] 'strong_buy_combined' -> 0.65
  - [x] 'buy_combined' -> 0.35
  - [x] 'technical_strong_buy' -> 0.40
  - [x] 'technical_minimum' -> 0.25
  - [x] 'fundamental_minimum' -> 0.10
  - [x] 'min_backtest_return' -> 10.0
  - [x] Keep 'volume_confirmation_required' = True
- [x] STOCK_FILTERING tighten:
  - [x] 'min_volume' -> 100000
  - [x] 'min_historical_days' -> 250
  - [x] Add min delivery/turnover filter if available from provider
- [x] THREADING: keep MAX_WORKER_THREADS=2 for rate limits; revisit after caching

8) Fundamentals and sentiment
- [x] Fundamentals as tie-breaker: prefer positive EPS growth, low debt/equity, stable margins
- [x] Sector filter: avoid weak sector regimes even if single stock looks good
- [x] Sentiment: cap contribution; use only to down-rank high-risk events

9) Deliverables and QA
- [x] Add unit tests for each gate (trend/vol/volume/MTF) with fixture charts
- [x] Golden-run notebooks/reports for prior quarter showing precision and MAE
- [ ] Canary deploy with shadow recommendations; compare with production for 2 weeks
- [x] Document playbook: entry/exit, position sizing, and monitoring

10) Optional ML layer (after rule-set stabilizes)
- [x] Feature set: returns(1/5/10), RSI regimes, ADX, ATR bands, volume Z, pattern flags
- [x] Train classifier to predict 10–20 bar positive R multiple; calibrate with Platt scaling
- [x] Use as secondary ranker; do not override rule-based hard gates

Notes
- Swing-trading “~90% accuracy” is unrealistic in markets; aim for high precision with controlled risk and positive expectancy. We will optimize for precision, R-multiple, and drawdown, and transparently report metrics.
