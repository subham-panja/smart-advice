# "Super Advice" Strategic Enhancement Roadmap - TODO List

### Phase 1: Market Intelligence & Data Infrastructure

**1.1. Market Regime Detection**
- [ ] Implement Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to identify distinct market states (bull, bear, volatile).
- [ ] Implement GARCH models (specifically MRS-GARCH) for volatility regime switching analysis.
- [ ] Implement advanced clustering algorithms (e.g., Wasserstein-based K-Means) for regime classification based on price, volume, and correlation features.

**1.2. Advanced Data Integration**
- [ ] Integrate Level 2 and Level 3 order book data feeds for granular market microstructure analysis.
- [ ] Develop pipelines for ingesting and processing alternative data sources:
  - [ ] Social media commentary (for real-time sentiment).
  - [ ] Satellite imagery (for physical activity tracking).
  - [ ] Transactional data (for consumer spending trends).
- [ ] Implement order imbalance analysis to create short-term predictive signals from order flow.

### Phase 2: Advanced Predictive Modeling

**2.1. Deep Learning Implementation**
- [ ] Develop and integrate hybrid deep learning models for time series forecasting (e.g., CNN-LSTM, LSTM-Transformer).
- [ ] Enhance the feature engineering pipeline to include lag features, rolling window statistics, and cyclical encodings.
- [ ] Explore transforming technical indicators into image-like representations for CNN-based analysis.
- [ ] Implement ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models for improved accuracy.

**2.2. Dynamic Strategy Adaptation**
- [ ] Create a dynamic strategy weighting module that adjusts strategy allocations based on the detected market regime.
- [ ] Implement dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms that adapt to real-time volatility and market conditions.
- [ ] Integrate predictive volatility models (e.g., GARCH forecasts) to set more accurate, forward-looking risk parameters.

### Phase 3: Intelligent Optimization & Execution

**3.1. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Integration**
- [ ] Develop an RL framework for generating optimal trading recommendations.
- [ ] Implement and test various RL algorithms (e.g., DQN for discrete actions, PPO/A2C for continuous actions like position sizing).
- [ ] Use RL to learn dynamic capital allocation and portfolio rebalancing strategies.

**3.2. Advanced Portfolio Optimization**
- [ ] Implement the Black-Litterman model to blend market equilibrium returns with the system's quantitative forecasts.
- [ ] Implement Risk Parity strategies for volatility-balanced risk allocation across assets.
- [ ] Enhance Risk Parity with macro-economic indicators to make it "macro-aware."
- [ ] Develop a Statistical Arbitrage and Pairs Trading module:
  - [ ] Use advanced pair selection methods (clustering, Hurst exponent).
  - [ ] Model the pair spread using Kalman Filters and Copulas for non-linear dependencies.

**3.3. Execution and Cost Optimization**
- [ ] Implement a Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) framework to measure and analyze implicit trading costs (slippage, market impact).
- [ ] Use TCA insights to optimize trading algorithms and inform pre-trade decision-making.
