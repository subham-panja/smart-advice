Compact digest (concise, action-first)

Below is a short, actionable summary of digest.txt with the key information, files, commands, priorities and immediate action items. I pulled the content from the repository files you uploaded. Citations point to the source locations in the uploaded digest.txt. 
 

1) One-line summary

Smart Advice — an AI-powered swing-trading platform (Next.js frontend + Flask backend, MongoDB) offering technical/fundamental/sentiment analysis, ML/RL models, backtesting, and an extensible strategy library. 

2) Quick inventory (what’s in the repo)

Top-level: README.md, improvement.txt, start.sh, start.bat, smart_advice/ project tree. 

Backend: Flask app (backend/app.py), run_analysis.py, analysis/core modules, ml/ trainers, scripts/ (data_fetcher, analyzer, risk management, backtesting), DB utilities, test suite. 

Frontend: Next.js 15 + TypeScript app under frontend/ with components, pages, Tailwind config and tests. 

Docs: README.md (install & API overview) and backend/docs/TRADING_PLAYBOOK.md (detailed trading playbook). 

3) Core features & architecture (compact)

Analysis stack: Technical indicators (TA-Lib), fundamental metrics, news/sentiment pipeline, multi-strategy backtesting, risk manager, ML secondary ranker and RL agents. 

Data sources: yfinance (primary), optional alternative data pipeline (google/news/social) scaffolding in scripts. 

DB / cache: MongoDB primary, Redis for caching (mentioned). 

UI: Real-time dashboard (Chart.js), dark mode, responsive layout. 

4) Install & run (essential commands)

Backend quick start (from backend/): create venv → pip install -r requirements.txt → python app.py (Flask on port 5001). 

Frontend (from frontend/): npm install → npm run dev (Next.js on port 3000). 

Repo start scripts: start.sh (Unix) and start.bat (Windows) automate the above (create venv, install deps, create .env.local with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5001). 

5) Key API endpoints (short)

GET / — health check.

GET /recommendations — fetch recommendations (enhanced with analytics/backtest fields).

POST /trigger-analysis — start analysis (configurable JSON: max_stocks, test, all, offline, verbose, purge_days, disable_volume_filter).

GET /analysis-progress — progress & runtime stats.

GET /symbols and GET /test_data/<symbol> — symbol list & data check endpoints. 

6) Tests & quality checks

Automated tests: Backend unit/integration tests in backend/tests/ (system/complete tests, data fetch tests). npm and Playwright/Jest used for frontend tests. 

System tests: There are scripts that exercise analyzer, API endpoints and data fetching (e.g. test_complete_system.py, test_data_fetch.py). 

7) Missing features & suggested priorities (from improvement.txt)

High priority

Add a built-in stock screener/scanner (filters on momentum, volume spikes, pattern triggers). 

Implement Ease of Movement (EoM) and SuperTrend indicators (and Donchian Channels) to improve signal coverage. 

Integrate alternative data (Google Trends, Twitter/Reddit sentiment, news feed) into the pipeline. 

Medium priority

Embed richer charting (TradingView widget, Renko/Heikin-Ashi), add heatmaps and expanded pattern recognition (cup-and-handle, double-top/bottom, Camarilla pivots). 

Low priority

Add classical time-series models (ARIMA/Prophet) as forecasting alternatives to ML/RL. 

8) Immediate action items (concrete)

Smoke test: Run start.sh (or start backend + frontend manually) then GET / and GET /recommendations to confirm baseline. (See ports 5001/3000). 
 

Run tests: python backend/tests/test_complete_system.py and python -m pytest backend/tests to surface integration failures. 

Enable alternative data: If using social/news signals, check scripts/alternative_data_fetcher.py presence and enable pipeline (config flags). If missing, plan integration with Google Trends / news API (high priority). 

Add screener MVP: Implement a simple server endpoint GET /screener which filters NSE cached symbols by volume, RSI, moving averages. This addresses the largest UX gap. 

9) Where to find important files (quick map)

Repo root / README: install, scripts, features. 

backend/app.py — main Flask app & endpoints. 

backend/scripts/ — analyzer, data_fetcher, backtesting, risk management. 

backend/ml/ — classifier, feature extractor, secondary ranker. 

backend/docs/TRADING_PLAYBOOK.md — trading rules, gates, position sizing, risk rules (v2.0). 

10) Recommended next 3-week roadmap (very short)

Week 1: Run full system tests; fix critical failures; add screener MVP endpoint. 

Week 2: Integrate EoM & SuperTrend, add Donchian filter into strategy set; wire indicator outputs into UI. 

Week 3: Add lightweight alternative-data ingestion (news + Google Trends), expose basic sentiment scores in recommendations API. 

11) Copy-ready checklist (one line items for PRs)

 Add /screener endpoint with server-side filters.

 Implement EoM & SuperTrend indicators + unit tests.

 Add Google Trends + news ingestion script and sentiment mapping.

 Expose backtest_metrics summary (CAGR, win_rate, max_drawdown) in /recommendations.
