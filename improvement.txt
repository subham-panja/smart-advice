Missing Features (by category)

Indicators: The Smart Advice app lacks some popular swing-trading indicators. For example, the Ease of Movement (EoM) oscillator – which “combines volume and price range to indicate how effortlessly price is shifting”
en.arincen.com
 – is highly recommended in free swing-trading guides but not implemented. Likewise, the SuperTrend indicator (widely used to spot trend breakouts in swing trading
blog.elearnmarkets.com
) is missing. Other common indicators not currently covered include Donchian Channels (for breakout entries), Renko/Heikin-Ashi chart filters, and trend-based stops like the SuperTrend.

Chart Patterns/Strategies: Some classic patterns frequently cited by educators are not present. For example, cup-and-handle and double-top/bottom reversals (often taught in swing-trading courses) are not explicitly recognized by the platform’s pattern modules. Similarly, while Smart Advice handles candlestick patterns and channels, it could add other setups like Camarilla or Woodie pivot-point strategies and gap-trading variations (beyond the basic gap strategy) which are commonly discussed in free forums and videos.

Technical Scanning Tools: Unlike platforms like FinViz and TradingView, Smart Advice has no built-in stock screener or scanner. Free swing traders often rely on screeners to filter stocks by technical/fundamental criteria; for example, “FINVIZ is the best screener for swing traders because of the breadth of its screening criteria, real-time data, backtesting capabilities, and alerts”
investopedia.com
. Enhancement: Integrate a dynamic screening tool (e.g. filters on momentum, volume spikes, pattern triggers) or an API connection to a free screener (Finviz, AlphaVantage, etc.) so users can automatically generate trade candidate lists.

Data Sources (Alternative/Macro): Smart Advice currently uses basic market data (via Yahoo Finance) and disabled alternative data. It lacks non-price data that free resources emphasize. For example, alternative data like Google search trends, web traffic, or social media sentiment are increasingly cited as swing signals. As one guide notes, “alternative financial data can provide crucial insights that align perfectly with your trading strategy” and help “spot emerging opportunities”

. Enhancement: Incorporate Google Trends or similar keyword trend tracking, plus social sentiment (Twitter/Reddit/StockTwits) and news feeds into the analysis. Also consider adding macroeconomic indicators (FOMC dates, inflation, PMI) or sector rotation data, since broad economic context often informs swing setups in free tutorials.

Visualization Tools: The app’s current charts (Chart.js) could be augmented by more advanced visuals. Many free traders use interactive charts (e.g. TradingView widget) with drawing tools, multi-timeframe views, Renko/point-and-figure charts, etc. Enhancement: Add features like an intra-dashboard market heatmap (to see sector performance), renko/heikin-ashi chart types, or integration with an embeddable TradingView chart for richer user interaction.

Backtesting and Performance Analytics: Although Smart Advice has a backtest engine, free resources often leverage specialized frameworks (Backtrader, Zipline) and emphasize performance metrics. It may lack features like walk-forward analysis, parameter optimization, or Monte Carlo risk simulations. Enhancement: Enable walk-forward/backtest visualization (equity curves) and expose portfolio-level analytics (Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown, etc. – some are coded but ensure they appear in UI). Tools like TradingView (free strategy tester) allow quick backtests

; Smart Advice could similarly allow users to test custom rules or strategies against historical data.

Forecasting Techniques: Smart Advice uses ML/RL models, but simpler statistical forecasts are common in free content. For instance, many swing traders experiment with ARIMA/GARCH or Facebook Prophet for price forecasting. Enhancement: Include a module for classical time-series forecasting (e.g. ARIMA or Prophet) as an alternative to black-box ML, along with basic volatility models or VIX analysis often mentioned in educational blogs.

Trading Tools: General utilities popular in the community are missing. These include a watchlist tracker with alerts, position-sizing/Kelly calculators, and a trading journal interface. Many free platforms (e.g. Webull, TradingView) offer alerts and notes. Enhancement: Add alert/notification capabilities (email/push) and a journal/log feature to record trades and review performance – features often cited by swing-trade educators as essential for discipline.

Recommendations & Enhancements

Add Popular Indicators (High Priority): Implement the Ease of Movement (EoM) indicator
en.arincen.com
 and SuperTrend breakout indicator
blog.elearnmarkets.com
 as additional signals. These are explicitly recommended by swing-trading educators but currently absent. Also consider adding Donchian Channels and other breakout filters that complement the existing MA/RSI/ATR suite.

Integrate a Stock Screener (High Priority): Build or integrate a free stock screening function so users can filter by technical/fundamental criteria. For example, allow filtering by volume spikes, price rank, RSI range, etc. This matches platforms like FinViz (praised as “best for swing traders”
investopedia.com
) and would help users quickly find swing candidates without manual symbol entry.

Incorporate Alternative Data (High Priority): Activate and expand the alternative-data pipeline. Integrate Google Trends API to flag surges in keyword interest, and ingest social sentiment (Twitter/Reddit) to gauge crowd mood. Add a news sentiment feed (e.g. free news API) to detect breaking news. These sources “provide early signals” that “short- to medium-term trends” are developing

, which is vital for swing timing.

Enhance Charting & Visualization (Medium Priority): Upgrade the dashboard with interactive/multi-chart support. Embed a TradingView or similar JS charting widget to allow zooming, annotations, and alternate chart types (Renko, Heikin-Ashi). Add a market/sector heatmap or correlation matrix to visualize overall breadth – free traders often use these for “big picture” context (see FinViz heatmaps or sector rotation charts on TradingView).

Expand Pattern Library (Medium Priority): Include additional chart patterns and pivot variations. For example, implement recognition for double-top/bottom, cup-and-handle, and Camarilla pivot levels. These classic patterns appear frequently in swing-trading tutorials and can catch formations the current pattern set misses.

Enrich Backtesting & Risk Analysis (Medium Priority): Improve the backtest interface to allow portfolio-level testing and advanced optimization (e.g. walk-forward, parameter sweeps). Display common performance metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, drawdown) clearly on results. Consider adding Monte Carlo simulation for drawdown risk (a feature found in some free trading platforms).

Add Forecasting Options (Low Priority): Offer simpler statistical forecast models (e.g. ARIMA or Prophet) as alternatives to the existing ML. Some swing traders favor these to project next-period prices or volatility. Also, consider adding analysis of volatility indices (like VIX) or options-derived metrics, since implied volatility trends are often discussed in community resources.

Prioritization of Improvements

Stock Screener & Scanning (Highest): Community sources repeatedly stress the need for a built-in screener (e.g. FINVIZ) and alerts
investopedia.com
. A high-priority enhancement is adding this capability, as it has broad impact on usability.

Key Indicators (High): Adding Ease of Movement and SuperTrend should be done quickly, as multiple swing-trading guides cite them as top indicators
en.arincen.com
blog.elearnmarkets.com
. These will directly improve signal coverage.

Alternative Data Integration (High): Given the rising use of Google Trends and social sentiment in swing strategies

medium.com
, incorporating these data sources is high impact for uncovering new insights.

Enhanced Charting/Visualization (Medium): Interactive charts and heatmaps significantly improve analysis, though they require UI work. They should follow core analytics enhancements.

Expanded Pattern Library (Medium): Adding a few more well-known patterns (double top, cup-handle, Camarilla pivots) will round out the strategy set with moderate effort.

Backtest & Risk Tools (Medium): Upgrading backtesting (portfolio mode, metrics) is valuable but lower priority than data inputs and core indicators.

Forecasting Models (Low): Classic statistical models are least-urgent; the ML/RL already covers forecasting, so these can be added after the higher-impact features.
